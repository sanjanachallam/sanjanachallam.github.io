Multi‑page portfolio starter
============================

How to use
1) Open each HTML file and replace placeholders (Your Name, role, city, etc.).
2) Add your headshot at img/headshot.jpg (create the img/ folder).
3) Put your resume.pdf in the root so the button works.
4) Push these files to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages).

Files
- index.html              (Home / hero with resume CTA)
- about.html              (Education, Professional background, Skills, Awards, Memberships)
- projects.html           (Numbered projects with bullets and preview links)
- professional.html       (Conferences/Tours/Community)
- contact.html            (Address, email, phone, LinkedIn/WhatsApp links)
- style.css               (shared styling)
- README.txt

Tip: To avoid copy/paste for the header/footer in the future, consider GitHub Pages + Jekyll with includes.
